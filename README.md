# Creating a Log in page Using ReactJS

The project is really a time saving for developers, you can download the code and make your personal modification easily
and get your login page. 
The project is purely front end so you need to add the backend if you want to link it with a database.
I used a list to verify the given email and password of the user
Here is a preview of the project

Technologies Used: Html, Css, ReactJS.
Whoever got the code, good luck with your development career :D
